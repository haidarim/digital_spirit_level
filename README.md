# Digital Spirit Level


This project was carried out by Mehdi Haidari, Theodor Ahlgren and Baseer Qayoumi at Chalmers University of Technology as part of their examination.

## Project Specifications:
Utilize a dual-axis accelerometer to gauge acceleration. Subsequently, exhibit the inclination of the spirit level on an LCD screen (DMC 16117A). Additionally, transmit the data via USB (RS232) to a personal computer.

Initiate by integrating the accelerometer, USB interface, LCD-displayer, and 7-segment display on the FPGA board.
